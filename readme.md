# Quiz Creator
Adds a simple quiz system to the [WoltLab® Suite Core(WSC)](https://www.woltlab.com/features/) that allows the team to create quizzes for members of one community.

There are two types of quizzes:
  * __Competition__ - where members compete against each other for the high score. The value of the correct answer drops from 10 points to 1 over time.
  * __Fun__ - Here it doesn't matter how long it takes, there is always 1 point, at the end you can present a funny evaluation via goals.
